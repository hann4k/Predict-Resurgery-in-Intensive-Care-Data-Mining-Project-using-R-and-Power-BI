# Predict-Resurgery-in-Intensive-Care-Data-Mining-Project-using-R-and-Power-BI
I have used data mining classification and modeling techniques to identify and predict the potential patients that may need re-surgery by using their medical history and demographics combined with the medical knowledge of the health professionals. A sample Intensive Care dataset is taken from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) to create this model, and visualizations are developed using Power BI.
